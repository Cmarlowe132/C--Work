1. To compile the regular quicksort algorithm, use the makefile command 'quicksort' by typing 
make quicksort

into the terminal, this will create the executable file quicksort which can be ran by typing
./quicksortRun

into the terminal. 

2. To compile the quicksortAnalysis, use the makefile command 'quicksortAnalysis' by typing
make quicksortAnalysis

into the terminal. This will create the executable file quicksortAnalysis which can be ran by typing
./quicksortAnalysisRun

into the terminal

3. To remove the executable files after they are created, delete them using the makefile command 'clean' by typing 
make clean

into the terminal.

4. For both of these programs, there are no files needs to pass via the command line, however they must be in a directory with a file named input.txt
The input.txt file must be populated prior for the quicksort program, but does not need to be populated before the quicksortAnalysis program.
