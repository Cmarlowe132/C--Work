This program will take in an input file named "input.txt" which should be full of integer values

To run the program, compile using the command 

make HeapBottomUp

which will create the executable file HeapBottomUpRun which can be ran using 

./HeapBottomUpRun 

in the console.

A file named output.txt will be created with the resulting heap, and output to the console will be the time the heap construction took. 

To compile Heapsort run the command

make Heapsort

in the command line. This will create an executable file named HeapSortRun which can be ran by typing

./HeapSortRun

in the command line. This program has the same requirements as the last, being in the same directory as a file named "input.txt" and will
create an output file named "output.txt" which will have the original heap for the input, and the sorted outcome. 
In the console will be the total run time of heapSort
