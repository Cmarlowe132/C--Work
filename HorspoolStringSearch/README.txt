This program will take in an input file named "input.txt" where the first ine contains the pattern to be searched for and line two contains the text to search through

To run the program, compile using the command 

make Horspool

which will create the executable file HeapBottomUpRun which can be ran using 

./Horspool

in the console.

A file named output.txt will be created with the resulting matching index, and output to the console will be the time the searching took.
